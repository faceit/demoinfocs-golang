# Creating a heatmap

This example shows how to create a heatmap from positions where players fired their weapons from.

See `heatmap.go` for the source code.

## Running the example

`go run heatmap.go -demo /path/to/demo > out.jpg`

This will create a JPEG of a radar overview with dots on all the locations where shots were fired from.
